Since
[2.0.0-alpha.7](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/releases/tag/2.0.0-alpha.7)
release it's possible to launch reanimated 2 in a web browser. For that case all of the functionalities are implemented purely in javascript, hence the efficiency of the animations might drop.

If you use
[playground](https://github.com/software-mansion-labs/reanimated-2-playground)
and want to start the app in the browser, just type:
```
yarn web
```

If you want to start example applications from the 
[reanimated repository](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated)
you need to run a following command inside the `Example` directory:
```
yarn start-web
```
