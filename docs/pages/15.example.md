# Examples

---

The source code for the example (showcase) app is under the [`Example/`](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-reanimated/blob/master/Example/) directory.

In order to run it you need to pull in the repository, enter `Example/` folder and run:

```bash
  yarn install
```

Then run `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios` (depending on which platform you want to run the Example app on).

You will need to have an Android or iOS device or emulator connected as well as `react-native-cli` package installed globally.
