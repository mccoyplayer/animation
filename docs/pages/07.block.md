# Blocks

---

Blocks are just arrays of nodes that are being evaluated in a particular order and return the value of the last node. It can be created using `block` command but also when passed as an argument to other nodes the `block` command can be omitted and we can just pass a nodes array directly. See an example below:

```js
block(
  set(tmp, a), 
  set(a, b), 
  set(b, tmp)
);
```

Passing array directly is equivalent to wrapping it with the `block` command.
