# Views, props, etc

---

Follow the original `Animated` library guides to learn how values can be connected to View attributes.
Similarly with `react-native-reanimated` you need to use components prefixed with `Animated.` (remember to [import](getting-started.html#installation) `Animated` from reanimated package). For example:

```js
import Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';

// use
<Animated.View/>
// instead of
<View/>
```
