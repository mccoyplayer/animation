# React Native Reanimated

React Native's Animated library reimplemented.

- **Native Performance**: Declare your animations in JS, but have them run on the native thread! 🧙‍♂️
- **Precise Animations**: The API affords new levels of precision and detailed control of your animations. 🕹
- **(mostly) Backwards Compatible**: Use the same Animated API from React Native that you've been using. You generally don't _need_ to change anything to get started. 👍

Reanimated provides a more comprehensive, low level abstraction for the Animated library API, giving you much greater flexibility, control and performance. Combine it with [react-native-gesture-handler](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler) for performant gesture-based interactions.
